# ðŸŽ¨ Onboarding Experience with Ebru Art - React NativeðŸŒ·

While everyone is busy experimenting with AI-generated color palettes, the richness of the colors I've crafted with my earth pigments feels like a whole new world! In this magical space where technology meets art, each brushstroke is eager to proclaim, "I've arrived!" in front of any AI algorithm!

Bringing Ebru into the design turns the user experience into a delightful aesthetic journey.

## âœ¨ Aesthetic:

The background, decorated with Ebru's unique patterns, creates a calming and captivating atmosphere for users. This artistic touch not only draws users in but also builds their trust in the application.

## ðŸ’Ž Trust and Appeal:

An aesthetically pleasing onboarding process wraps users in a warm and welcoming experience as they dive into the app. The grace of Ebru, combined with user-friendly designs, makes the application even more inviting.

## ðŸŒˆ The Fusion of Art and Technology:

It's incredibly exciting to explore what happens when art and technology come together. With this project, I aimed to blend these two worlds to create a truly unique user experience.
